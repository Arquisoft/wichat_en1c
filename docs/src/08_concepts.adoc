== Cross-cutting Concepts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== User Experience (UX)

The user experience in the system involves the design of the user interface and the level of accessibility, usability and
satisfaction that it provides. As the part of the system that the user interacts with, the focus is put in providing
a user-friendly interface, which gives a proper user experience. This user experience is a key concept in web applications
such as the one developed, in which a high degree of usability is required for the user's satisfaction and overall
experience.

=== Internationalization

As a key part of User Experience, Internationalization (i18n) is a very important part in the system. The adjustment
to several languages and the flexibility it provides, allows the system to be user-friendly, providing a high usability
to several types of users based on their languages, overrunning language barriers.

=== Architectural patterns

The system follows several architectural patterns: Microservices pattern, so the system is composed of different
independent components, and Gateway pattern, which provides a single interface for all the users that manages
and redirects all their requests. The use of these architectural patterns provides a high degree of mantainability
and also high flexibility in the development. 

=== Security

As a key in all types of systems, security is a very important concept in this one and its development. Resources and data
are protected and only provided to allowed users, implementing an authentication systemps that enforces the system's security.

=== Error handling

Proper error handling techniques are implemented in each system's component to ensure the reliability and availability
of the system. Every call or dependency between components or important parts is managed to throw and detect types 
of errors and not propagate them thorughout the application, sending proper messages and codes to the different
components to ensure the availability of the system and its proper working without failing. This enhances, in case
an error occurs, the user experience so the user is informed if some process can not be carried out.
