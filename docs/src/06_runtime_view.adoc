== Runtime View

[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/[Runtime View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Abstract states of the application

* General usage, the user arrives to the application, creates an account or logs in, goes through the menu settings and plays.
The state diagram shows the relation of the different situations of the app.

=== Login of a user

* Login, the app shows the login interface, where the user is asked for the username and password, and the possibility to create an account.

When logging, the app does a login request to the authentication service through the GatewayService, which redirects the user to the identity provider, which handles the authentication by checking the registered users.
If the login is succesfully, the app shows the different options of the game. In case the login isn't succesfully, a warning message is shown.

=== Game

* Game transitions and process behind the user interface.

When playing, the user interface interacts with the distribution facade Gateway, in charge of hiding the back-end services, business and persistance layers.

=== Statistics of a user

* Statistics of a user.

When the user enters the view, statistics about themselves are shown.
