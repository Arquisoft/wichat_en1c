== Test Report

Our application has been tested using the following methods:

=== Unit tests

Unit tests were written to *test each microservice* independently, by mocking the dependent microservices and ensure each microservice works as expected.

The unit tests were written using the *Jest* framework, which is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications.

==== Coverage

These tests have a *minimum required coverage of >80%* of the codebase which, at the time of writing this report is, *86.8%*.

For a more detailed report about the coverage, refer to the following https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?metric=coverage&view=list&id=Arquisoft_wichat_en1c[link].

=== Acceptance / integration tests (E2E tests)

Integration tests were written using the *Cucumber* framework, and *Jest* as the execution platform. 

A total of *five sets of tests* were created to ensure *all features* of the application are covered and tested.

These tests allow verifying that the system behaves as expected when *all components interact together*.

=== Load tests

Load tests were written using the *Gatling* framework, which is a popular testing framework for load testing.

A load test comprising *all the features except for custom games* was created and run by *20 active users* at a time. 
Overall the test output was *positive*, as the system was able to handle the most of the load without issues, thus proving the "performance" quality attribute.

- We detected that the question service struggled with *getting the first question*, which took *>1200ms* almost half of the time. The question service should be improved to be able to handle more requests.

- Also, we detected that serving the background video stream was a bottleneck, so it should be moved to an external *CDN* to alliviate the load on the *WebApp*.
