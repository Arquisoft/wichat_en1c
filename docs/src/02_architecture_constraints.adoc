== Architecture Constraints


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technical Constraints

[options="header"]
|===
| Constraint                              | Explanation
| WikiData                                | The application requires data retrieval and processing to generate questions using images from WikiData.
| Version control and monitoring (GitHub) | GitHub is a useful tool for version control and collaboration among the team members working on the project.
| User Experience (UI and UX)             | The application's design must prioritize a user-friendly and intuitive experience.
| Test coverage                           | The code must achieve high test quality and coverage to ensure reliable and expected outcomes.
| Data Storage and Management             | User data must be stored securely and efficiently. In order to achieve this goal, database selection is crucial.
| LLM (Large Language Models)             | The application will leverage LLMs for specific functionalities (e.g., question generation, hint.)
| Web Accessible Front-End    | 	The application will be accessed through a web browser
