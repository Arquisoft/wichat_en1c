.Contents
The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in multi-language teams.

.Motivation
You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

* have an identical understanding of these terms
* do not use synonyms and homonyms


.Form

A table with columns <Term> and <Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/[Glossary] in the arc42 documentation.

|Term |Definition

| Question
| A set comprising: a textual question referring to an image, the image itself, and a series of options where one is correct while the others serve as distractors.

| Distractor
| A wrong answer to a question. The distractors are the options that are not correct, and they are used to mislead the user into selecting them instead of the correct answer.

| LLM (AI)
| A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence that uses deep learning techniques to understand and generate human-like text. It is trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and more. In the context of this project, the LLM is used to generate hints based on questions.

| Hint
| Textual clue or suggestion provided to the user (when requested) to help them answer a question correctly. These are generated by the LLM based on the question and the image associated with it.

| Docker 
| A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated environments called containers. Used in WiChat for service isolation and portability.

| Docker-compose 
| A tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications.

| Microservices Approach 
| The architectural style of building an application as a collection of small, independent services.

| API Gateway 
| The Gateway component that acts as a single entry point for all client interactions, simplifying access to backend services and enhancing security.

| HTTPS 
| Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, a protocol for secure communication over a computer network, widely used on the Internet.
