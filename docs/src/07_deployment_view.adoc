== Deployment View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

* distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between them
* important justifications or motivations for this deployment structure
* quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure
* mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

**Motivation:**

The system uses Docker to keep services isolated and portable, ensuring smooth transitions between development, testing, and production. A microservices approach separates key functions like authentication, game logic, stats, and question handling, allowing independent scaling and preventing failures in one service from affecting the rest.

A central API Gateway simplifies client interactions and enhances security by preventing direct access to internal services. External services like WikiData and an LLM API handle question generation and AI-driven hints, reducing infrastructure complexity and using external computing power.

**Quality and/or Performance Features:**

This system is built to handle growth. Each part can be scaled up as needed. In this diagram we use containers, so if we need more of something like the Question Service, we can easily add it. With Docker-compose we can automate this.

Security is important.The API Gateway adds a layer of security by managing and authenticating all incoming requests.

If something goes wrong, the container system helps because if one part fails, it can be restarted without affecting the others.  We also have logging and monitoring to help us find and fix problems quickly.

We've focused on performance too, MongoDB is used for flexible and efficient data storage for game info.
