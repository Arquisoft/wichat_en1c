== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Description
This project consists of a web application in which users can play a quiz game, as well as registering and logging in.
Also, it allows to consult information as an API. The quiz game's questions are generated using an LLM and WikiData.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

| **Communication Partner** | **Input** | **Output**
| _User_ | Interaction with the WebApp like answering to questions, introducing credentials and asking for user data. | Proper response to the interaction performed by the user. 
| _WIChat_ | Interaction by the user. | Data to the user like questions, question's results and user data. 
| _Wikidata_ | Queries from the application for obtaining information from Wikidata. | Data returned from the Wikidata database that is asked for in the query. 
| _LLM_ | Queries from the application for generating questions. | The questions that have been generated by the LLM.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
