== Building Block View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::

We divided the system into microservices according to their responsibilities to ensure: 
- *simplicity*:
  Each component is minimal and is responsible for a single function, which makes it easier to understand and maintain.
- *reusability*:
  Microservices have interfaces which can be easily used by other new or old components if required.
- *independence*:  
  Components are made as independent as possible, also dependencies are always on stable abstractions protecting client services from the implementation.
- *maintainability*:
  Each component is simple and as independent as possible from the others allowing fast understanding and reducing the probability of making mistakes.
- *extendability*:
  New features can be added easily by adding new code to components or by adding new components, avoiding having to modify / rewrite code.
- *switchability*:
  External services can be easily replaced by other services by just writing an adapter.

Contained Building Blocks::
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| **Building Block**      | **Brief description**
| LLM Service             | Serves as an adapter for the external LLM service.
| Questions Service       | Generates questions and hints.
| Game Service            | Manages game states and tracks the user's progress.
| Stats Service           | Tracks and provides statistics for the users.
| Auth Service            | Handles login, signup and session for the users.
| Gateway                 | Proxies some services to the Internet and supports the WebApp.
| WebApp                  | Provides the web UI.
|===

Interfacing::

- The different *microservices communicate* with each other via *RESTful APIs* using an *intranet*. 
- The *Gateway* and *WebApp* are the only services which allow external requests and communicate with eachother through *Internet*.
- LLM Service and Question Service also communicate with the external LLM service and the external question service respectively using the Internet.

Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

==== LLM Service

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****
endif::arc42help[]

Purpose::

Act as a bridge (adapter) between the external LLM service and the other internal services of the application.

Interface::

Internal RESTful API for communication with the other internal microservices.

// _<(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics>_

// _<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

// _<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

// _<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_

Structure::

Just an Express.js app with an adapter pattern for the LLM API.

==== Stats Service

Purpose::

Tracks and provides statistics for the users. 

Interface::

Internal RESTful API for communication with the other internal microservices.

Structure::

It's a typical Express.js application with a model for the statistics and a database connector to allow storing the data.

==== WebApp

Purpose::

Provides the web UI for the application.

Interface::

Web UI for the users.

Structure::

Follows the structure of a typical React application with several routes. 

==== Gateway

Purpose::

Proxies some services to the Internet and supports the WebApp. 
Adds "firewall" mechanisms typical of APIs: ratelimiting, HTTPs, security headers, etc.

Interface::

RESTful API exposed to the Internet with a subset of the internal services.

Structure::

It's a typical Express.js application with middleware, proxy and endpoint documentation modules.



=== Level 2

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

==== White Box "Questions Service"

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
...describes the internal structure of _building block 1_.
****
endif::arc42help[]

image::build_block_view/questions_service.drawio.svg[]

Purpose::

Generates questions and hints. 
- Questions and answers are generated through WikiData data.
- Hints are generated through the internal LLM Service.

Motivation::

Handles the responsibility of generating questions and hints.

- *Why is WikiData part of the module and not standalone?*

Since the service is used only for generating questions and answers (and this will most likely remain true), it is more efficient to have it as part of the module and reduce the overall system complexity at the cost of increasing the module's one.

- *Why are questions and hints generated separately?*

Since questions and hints have different data sources, generation algorithms and, most importantly, different responsibilities, it is better to have them separated to promote independence and the benefits that come from it.
