== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
endif::arc42help[]

**Purpose**

WiChat is an extension of a previous experimental web application that allowed users to answer quiz questions emulating the "Saber y Ganar" quiz show. This year, the system is being expanded by adding images accompanying all the questions and introducing a conversational hint system powered by an external Large Language Model, enhancing the user experience by providing dynamic and interactive assistance.

The project is requested by RTVE and developed by ChattySw, which will build the application using some pieces of code or modules from the work previously done by HappySw company, but creating the application from scracth.

**Scope of Work**

WiChat will expand the existing quiz system by:

- Retaining the core gameplay, where users answer image-based questions from various domains.
- Introducing an AI-powered hint system for interactive assistance.
- Keeping automation of questions using Wikidata, minimizing manual effort.
- Ensuring accessibility through a web-based platform.
- Add additional features such as custom games and an AI vs user game mode.
Additionally, the system should be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future improvements.

**Driving Forces**

The development of WiChat is guided by the following key goals:

- **Enhancing User Engagement:** Implementing an interactive AI-based hint system.
- **Automating Content Generation:** Using Wikidata to provide dynamically created questions.
- **Ensuring Accessibility:** Delivering a web-based solution that is easy to access and use.
- **Providing a Structured Experience:** Offering game statistics and historical data for users.

This document will outline the foundational aspects of the system, including its requirements, quality goals, stakeholder expectations and all the strategies and decisions taken.

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

The main requirements of the system that encapsulates the key features are:

- The system shall allow unregistered users to sign up.
- The system shall provide authentication for users to log in.
- The system shall allow registered users to log out.
- The system shall allow registered users to play.
- The system shall allow registered users to check their statistics.
- The system shall allow users to request hints for a question.

The complete list of requirements can be found in the xref:#section-annex[Annex] of the documentation.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Concrete Scenario
| Reliability | The system should be reliable and diverse in generating questions from Wikidata, having no more than 5% of questions with wrong distractors. AI hint system should be accurate and allucinations should be minimized to no more than 2%. The system shall handle user registrations, logins, game data storage and gameplay with an error rate of less than 1%.
| Performance Efficiency | The system should efficiently handle an increasing number of concurrent users up to 20 while keeping response times below 1 second. AI hint generation should not cause performance bottlenecks.
| Security | Users' personal data and authentication details should be securely stored. API requests should be protected from unauthorized access.
| Usability | The UI should be intuitive for first-time users, and game interactions should be easy to understand. The system learning time for a new user should be less than 1 hour.
| Maintainability | The architecture should be microservices to allow developers to easily add new game modes, AI features, or question sources without major system refactoring.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
